Welcome to GeoMinds!
We are very happy to present you our Group Project GeoMinds. GeoMinds is all about making learning fun and educational at the same time.
Me and my team developed a GeoQuiz for testing your knowledge about our countries. We worked with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, Javascript and PHP. Trello and Figma for planning VS Code, PHP Server, Git/GitHub for developing and source control. For planning and developing the project we had 1 week. I'm very proud of my team for completing our project before the submission date and we really hope you'll enjoy our Quiz as much as we enjoyed to be a part of!
